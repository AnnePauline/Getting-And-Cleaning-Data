#### Project for the Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera
Course - Nov-Dec 2016

####The purpose of this project is to demonstrate ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

#### The data are from an experiment called: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set
#### A full description of the experiment is available at:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

Description résumé: Data have been collected from smart phone carried by volunteers while performing various activities.

#### Data are downloaded from: 
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

#### The goal of the project is 
#####to download data coming from the above experiment and stored in a zip format on the web; 
#####extract from them only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation and 
#####create a tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject (volunteer) appropriately labelled with descriptive names

########Descriptions of the steps in Codebook.md

#### Files in this GitHub repository: 
#### run_analysis.R : 
R scipt to perform the tidy data requested from the raw data
#### CodeBook.md : 
a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that I have performed to clean up the
data. 
#### README.md 
a welcome file to introduce the work and explain how all of the scripts work and how they are connected
#### tidy.txt 
a tidy data set result of the run_analysis.R script, that can be used for later analysis.
